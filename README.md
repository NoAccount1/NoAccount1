<!---
ðŸ‘‹ Hi i'm a junior web developper (actually not graduated) who loves Angular and generally Google.

All knowledge my is from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) and i prefer practice than learn.

My main project is [Cracked Games](https://github.com/NoAccount1/noaccount1.github.io) which is hosted on FireBase

NoAccount1/NoAccount1 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
