ðŸ‘‹ Hi i'm a junior web developper (actually not graduated) who loves Angular and generally Google.

All knowledge my is from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) and i prefer practice than learn.

My main project is [Cracked Games](https://github.com/NoAccount1/noaccount1.github.io) which is hosted on FireBase

**__PS__ :** I'm french so i apologize if my english isn't verry good
